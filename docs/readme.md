# Docs

This folder contains documentation for tuxi. It's divided into 6 sections:

1. [General](general.md): Contains basic information about creating tasks and the properties in the task object. This applies to both normal and keyed tasks.
2. [Task](task.md): Gives more details specific to `tuxi.task()`.
3. [Keyed](keyed.md): Gives more details about what keyed tasks are, and how to use `tuxi.keyed()`.
4. [Config](config.md) _(WIP)_: Describes how to configure tuxi.
5. [Plugins](vue.md) _(WIP)_: Describes how the plugin system of tuxi works, and what typically goes into creating a plugin.
6. [Vue](vue.md) _(WIP)_: Discusses specific issues related to Vue and Vuex, and how to use the Vue/Vuex plugin to overcome them.

Though I've tried to be clear when describing how everything works, there are probably areas that could be improved. If there's anything that's at all hard to understand, please [create an issue](https://github.com/superMDguy/tuxi/issues/new), and I'll try to improve it.
